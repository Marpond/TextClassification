The 30-year-old right-back, who made her senior international debut in 2013, previously thought injuries might stop her from reaching the milestone.

"I was told at 20 years old that I wouldn't play past 27," Bronze said.

"I think that's why I never set 100 caps as a goal for England, I just wanted to play as much as possible."

Bronze, who signed for Barcelona from Manchester City in June, has scored 11 goals in her 99 England appearances.

"I've just had to work hard on being focused, doing everything right and just hope for the best, and obviously I've had a pretty successful career doing the things that I've done and my knee injuries haven't held me back too much," she added.

"You get struck down with injuries, it's just part and parcel of it and how you overcome it and how you use it as motivation I suppose."
